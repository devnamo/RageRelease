"Because sometimes, all you need is to smack a Tapori Tinda." 😮‍💨

RageRelease is a stress-busting mini web game where you click on Tapori Tinda — a fictional, overconfident troublemaker who keeps popping up just to annoy you. Your goal? Smack him back into oblivion and calm your rage, one thappad at a time.

💡 Why this game?
Built by a gurlie who codes for peace, this game is therapy — in pixels.
Also a fun excuse to learn:
-> Game logic with JavaScript
-> CSS grids & animations
-> Character design (hi Tapori Tinda)

🔧 Tech Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and a little love from Figma)
