"Because sometimes, all you need is to smack a Tapori Tinda." 😮‍💨

RageRelease is a stress-busting mini web game where you click on Tapori Tinda — a fictional, overconfident troublemaker who keeps popping up just to annoy you. Your goal? Smack him back into oblivion and calm your rage, one thappad at a time.

💡 Why this game?
Built by a gurlie who codes for peace, this game is therapy — in pixels.

Also a fun excuse to learn:

-> Game logic with JavaScript

-> CSS grids & animations
